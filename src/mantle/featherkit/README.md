# Featherkit

Featherkit is a lightweight wrapper on-top of the Mantle Framework. It's
designed to load the Mantle Framework without any existing configuration or need
to include scaffolded files from `alleyinteractive/mantle`.

Internally it depends on the `alleyinteractive/mantle-framework` entirely and
requiring this package will also require that package.
