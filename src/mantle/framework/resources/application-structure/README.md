# Application Structure

These are application kernels, providers, etc. that can be exported by running
`./bin/mantle vendor:publish --tags=application-structure`. They are not required by Mantle by
default but can be used to extend the functionality of framework by rolling your
own application kernels, providers, etc.

For a better starting point, see https://github.com/alleyinteractive/mantle which already has them included.
